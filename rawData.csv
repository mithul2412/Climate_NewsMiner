A further rise in global warming to 2.6C, which is expected by 2100 on the current path, will make these conditions another 35% more likely again, they added. “Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos,” said Clair Barnes, a WWA researcher from Imperial College London. “Without a faster transition away from planet-heating fossil fuels, California will continue to get hotter, drier, and more flammable,” she added. Despite coming to power after the fires’ worst destruction, US President Donald Trump has officially begun the process of leaving the Paris climate agreement, paused all foreign climate finance, promoted fossil fuels and announced restrictions on wind power."

Yet the recent EU parliamentary elections – which delivered significant gains for Europe’s far-right and dealt a blow to its green parties – alongside a recently leaked list of EU Council priorities for the next five years, indicate a marked U-turn in the EU’s commitment to climate action. The EU has faced a dramatically changed geopolitical situation over the past few years, marked by the upsurge of far-right political forces in several member states, growing trade-tensions with China, and a humanitarian disaster and heightened energy security risk caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine."

Brazil’s Fernando Haddad and France’s Bruno Le Maire promoted their proposal at the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, alongside IMF head Kristalina Georgieva and Kenyan finance minister Njuguna Ndung’u. “In a world where economic activities are increasingly transnational, we have to find new and creative ways to tax these activities [and] thus direct the revenues to common global endeavours such as ending hunger and poverty and fighting climate change,” said Haddad."

Wealthy governments have failed to provide $100 billion of climate finance a year they promised to developing countries by 2020, with the US responsible for the vast majority of the shortfall. Finance for adapting to climate change – rather than cutting emissions – has been particularly low."

Jaber and Kerry, who strode to the stage and shook Jaber’s hand when the speech ended, left the room together. The two held a meeting ahead of the conference on Sunday."
https://www.nasa.gov/missions/nisar/how-us-indian-nisar-satellite-will-offer-unique-window-on-earth/,How US-Indian NISAR Satellite Will Offer Unique Window on Earth,"The upcoming U.S.-India NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission will observe Earth like no mission before, offering insights about our planet’s ever-changing surface. The NISAR mission is a first-of-a-kind dual-band radar satellite that will measure land deformation from earthquakes, landslides, and volcanoes, producing data for science and disaster response. It will track how much glaciers and ice sheets are advancing or retreating and it will monitor growth and loss of forests and wetlands for insights on the global carbon cycle. As diverse as NISAR’s impact will be, the mission’s winding path to launch — in a few months’ time — has also been remarkable. Paul Rosen, NISAR’s project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, has been there at every step. He recently discussed the mission and what sets it apart."
https://science.nasa.gov/earth/water-on-earth/nasa-study-crops-forests-responding-to-changing-rainfall-patterns/,"NASA Study: Crops, Forests Responding to Changing Rainfall Patterns","A new NASA-led study has found that how rain falls in a given year is nearly as important to the world’s vegetation as how much. Reporting Dec. 11 in Nature, the researchers showed that even in years with similar rainfall totals, plants fared differently when that water came in fewer, bigger bursts. In years with less frequent but more concentrated rainfall, plants in drier environments like the U.S. Southwest were more likely to thrive. In humid ecosystems like the Central American rainforest, vegetation tended to fare worse, possibly because it could not tolerate the longer dry spells. Scientists have previously estimated that almost half of the world’s vegetation is driven primarily by how much rain falls in a year. Less well understood is the role of day-to-day variability, said lead author Andrew Feldman, a hydrologist and ecosystem scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Shifting precipitation patterns are producing stronger rainstorms — with longer dry spells in between — compared to a century ago."
https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/nasa-data-reveals-role-of-green-spaces-in-cooling-cities/,NASA Data Reveals Role of Green Spaces in Cooling Cities,"A recent study in Nature Communications used NASA satellite data to identify a major gap in global resilience to climate change: cities in the Global South have far less green space — and therefore less cooling capacity — than cities in the Global North. The terms Global North and Global South were used in the study to distinguish developed countries (mostly in the Northern Hemisphere) from developing nations (mostly in the Southern Hemisphere). Cities tend to be hotter than nearby rural areas because of the urban heat island effect. Heat-trapping dark surfaces such as sidewalks, buildings, and roads absorb heat from the Sun’s rays, which raises the temperature of the city. Extreme heat poses serious health threats for urban residents, including dehydration, heat stroke, and even death. Though not a cure-all, greenery provides shade and releases moisture into the air, cooling the surroundings. “Cities can strategically prioritize developing new green spaces in areas that have less green space,” said Christian Braneon, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York who was not affiliated with this study. “Satellite data can be really helpful for this.”"

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts. The agency’s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. The site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources."
https://www.nasa.gov/earth/first-greenhouse-gas-plumes-detected-with-nasa-designed-instrument/,First Greenhouse Gas Plumes Detected With NASA-Designed Instrument,"Using data from an instrument designed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the nonprofit Carbon Mapper has released the first methane and carbon dioxide detections from the Tanager-1 satellite. The detections highlight methane plumes in Pakistan and Texas, as well as a carbon dioxide plume in South Africa. The data contributes to Carbon Mapper’s goal to identify and measure greenhouse gas point-source emissions on a global scale and make that information accessible and actionable. Enabled by Carbon Mapper and built by Planet Labs PBC, Tanager-1 launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Aug. 16 and has been collecting data to verify that its imaging spectrometer, which is based on technology developed at NASA JPL, is functioning properly. Both Planet Labs PBC and JPL are members of the philanthropically funded Carbon Mapper Coalition."
https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02032025/trump-epa-greenhouse-gas-pollution-endangerment-finding/,"Trump, EPA Aim to Remove Finding That Mandates Action on Greenhouse Gas Pollution","President Donald Trump’s energy-focused executive orders and plan to slash more than half of the Environmental Protection Agency’s staff have made clear his team is mapping a far more radical retreat on climate change in his second term. In a signal he is ready to lead this reverse charge, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in recent days recommended to the White House that the agency should rescind its 16-year-old finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and the environment, according to several reports citing unnamed sources. The so-called endangerment finding is the foundation of all of EPA’s actions on climate change under the Clean Air Act. Eliminating it would lift the agency’s mandate to regulate carbon pollution from power plants, vehicles, landfills and oil and gas infrastructure. It would free the administration from the work undertaken during Trump’s first term, when EPA staff spent months crafting weak rules for those sectors that President Joe Biden’s administration ultimately overturned."
https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02032025/new-york-city-heating-systems/,"Windows Open, Heating On: A New York City Winter","When New Yorkers hear that familiar clinking sound throughout their houses or apartments, they know winter is here. It means the city’s century-old steam heating system is kicking into gear, insulating around 80 percent of buildings and their residents from the harsh northeastern cold. Though this system was a boon for the city when it was installed in the 1870s, many city officials and local residents are now concerned with its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. More than two-thirds of citywide emissions come from buildings—much of this from multi-family residential properties. Steam heating is both polluting and often inefficient. Beginning this year, things will start to change. A new building law passed in 2019, Local Law 97, is now being enforced, and it may incentivize local property owners to consider switching to a greener heating system, or at least make their systems more efficient. The city’s ability to reduce their building emissions to net zero by 2050, the law’s ultimate goal, depends on these changes."

Need Another Polluting Plant to Turn Plastic Waste Into Diesel Fuel?,"The company tried educational chatbots and cryptocurrency. Then nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, of movies and cars. Even a service to Catholic churches allowing them to manage their finances using blockchain instead of banks. None of it succeeded. Now, the firm with a troubled financial history has suddenly changed its plans to convert roughly 7,000 tons of plastic each year into ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel in a low-income neighborhood in Fayetteville where more than 70 percent of 731 residents in the census block group are minorities, and 38 percent are low-income, according to state data. The facility would have been just 900 feet from Blounts Creek, a tributary to the Cape Fear River."
https://insideclimatenews.org/news/01032025/dominion-liquified-natural-gas-storage-facility-virginia/,Dominion Gets State Approval for Liquified Natural Gas Storage Facility in Virginia,"Virginia’s largest utility received approval from its state regulators to construct a liquified natural gas storage facility for two of its gas-fired power stations in the Southside region of the state, despite opposition from environmental groups that favor more renewable energy. Dominion Energy received approval from the State Corporation Commission Monday to build the 25-million gallon LNG storage facility, capable of storing up to 2 billion cubic feet. The tank would be for the utility’s 1,358-megawatt Brunswick and 1,588-megawatt Greensville power stations—both of which use combined cycle turbines that burn gas and capture steam—and are named after the counties they’re located in. “The Project is needed to maintain a readily available, safe, and reliable fuel source for Brunswick County and Greensville County Power Stations in the event of a natural disaster, extreme weather, or other supply disruptions or constraints,” said Jeffirey G. Miscikowski, Dominion Energy vice president of project construction, in testimony on the facility."
https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28022025/todays-climate-birds-live-long-vulnerable-to-global-warming/,"Birds That Live Long and Slow May Be More Vulnerable to Climate Change, Research Finds","Live fast, die young—or live long and hedge your bets? These are two of the strategies that the world’s non-migratory, non-marine bird species have employed throughout evolutionary history to survive in different environments, while maximizing their ability to breed and avoid extinction. Research shows birds that live in areas with higher temperature variability within a year typically have shorter lifespans, reproducing early and often. Meanwhile, avian species tend to live longer in environments that are more variable year-to-year because their extended lifespans allow for more wiggle room to skip a breeding season or two if conditions aren’t ideal. However, hedging your bets in this way may not be the right option when climate change stacks the game against you, according to a new study. While longer-lived birds may be more robust during their lifetimes, “fast” species will likely be quicker to evolve to the rapidly rising temperatures, the research finds."
